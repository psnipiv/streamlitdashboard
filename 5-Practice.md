It is one of the peculiar classic track  with fast, sweeping corners. Each corner has a unique name starting from 
Abbey, Farm, Village, The Loop, Aintree, Brooklands, Luffield, Woodcote, Copse, Maggots, Becketts, Chapel, Stowe, Vale and Club. Some of the corners seems to very demanding with the new tyre compounds and faster machinery. Also last weekend witnessed 4 tryes failures including Danil Kvyat's crash at Maggotts & Becketts due to the right rear puncture.
The tyre compounds for this weekend is C2, C3 and C4 which is softer than the previous week's C1, C2 and C3 and testing soft tyres for the right setup was primary objective in practice 1.
